          This Privacy Policy applies to personal data in our possession or

            <ol class="nested">
              <li>
                As used in this Privacy Policy: “customer” means an individual
                who (a) has contacted us through any means to find out more
                about any goods or services we provide, or (b) may, or has,
                entered into a contract with us for the supply of any goods or
                services by us; and “personal data” means data, whether true or
                not, about a customer who can be identified: (a) from that data;

                are likely to have access.
              </li>
              <li>
                Depending on the nature of your interaction with us, some
                examples of personal data which we may collect from you include
                your name and identification information such as your NRIC
                number, contact information such as your address, email address
                or telephone number, nationality, gender, date of birth, marital
                status, photographs and other audio-visual information,

              </li>
              <li>
                Other terms used in this Privacy Policy shall have the meanings
                given to them in the PDPA (where the context so permits).

            <ol class="nested">
              <li>
                We generally do not collect your personal data unless (a) it is
                provided to us voluntarily by you directly or via a third party
                who has been duly authorised by you to disclose your personal
                data to us (your “authorised representative”) after (i) you (or
                your authorised representative) have been notified of the
                purposes for which the data is collected, and (ii) you (or your
                authorised representative) have provided written consent to the
                collection and usage of your personal data for those purposes,
                or (b) collection and use of personal data without consent is
                permitted or required by the PDPA or other laws. We shall seek
                your consent before collecting any additional personal data and
                before using your personal data for a purpose which has not been
                notified to you (except where permitted or authorised by law).
              </li>
              <li>
                We may collect and use your personal data for any or all of the

                to, handling, and processing queries, requests, applications,
                complaints, and feedback from you; (d) managing your
                relationship with us; (e) processing payment or credit
                transactions; (f) sending your marketing information about our
                goods or services including notifying you of our marketing
                events, initiatives and promotions, lucky draws, membership and
                rewards schemes and other promotions; (g) complying with any
                applicable laws, regulations, codes of practice, guidelines, or
                rules, or to assist in law enforcement and investigations
                conducted by any governmental and/or regulatory authority; (h)
                any other purposes for which you have provided the information;
                (i) transmitting to any unaffiliated third parties including our
                third party service providers and agents, and relevant
                governmental and/or regulatory authorities, whether in Singapore
                or abroad, for the aforementioned purposes; and (j) any other
                incidental business purposes related to or in connection with
                the above.
              </li>
              <li>
                We may disclose your personal data: (a) where such disclosure is
                required for performing obligations in the course of or in
                connection with our provision of the goods or services requested
                by you; or (b) to third party service providers, agents and
                other organisations we have engaged to perform any of the
                functions listed in clause 5 above for us.
              </li>
              <li>
                The purposes listed in the above clauses may continue to apply
                even in situations where your relationship with us (for example,
                pursuant to a contract) has been terminated or altered in any
                way, for a reasonable period thereafter (including, where
                applicable, a period to enable us to enforce our rights under
                any contract with you).

              <li>
                The consent that you provide for the collection, use and
                disclosure of your personal data will remain valid until such
                time it is being withdrawn by you in writing. You may withdraw
                consent and request us to stop using and/or disclosing your
                personal data for any or all of the purposes listed above by
                submitting your request in writing or via email to our Data
                Protection Officer at the contact details provided below.
              </li>
              <li>
                Upon receipt of your written request to withdraw your consent,
                we may require reasonable time (depending on the complexity of
                the request and its impact on our relationship with you) for
                your request to be processed and for us to notify you of the
                consequences of us acceding to the same, including any legal
                consequences which may affect your rights and liabilities to us.
                In general, we shall seek to process your request within ten
                (10) business days of receiving it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Whilst we respect your decision to withdraw your consent, please
                note that depending on the nature and scope of your request, we
                may not be in a position to continue providing our goods or
                services to you and we shall, in such circumstances, notify you
                before completing the processing of your request. Should you
                decide to cancel your withdrawal of consent, please inform us in
                writing in the manner described in clause 8 above. 11. Please
                note that withdrawing consent does not affect our right to
                continue to collect, use and disclose personal data where such
                collection, use and disclose without consent is permitted or
                required under applicable laws.

                writing within thirty (30) days of the time by which we will be

                collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or
                similar risks, we have introduced appropriate administrative,
                physical and technical measures such as up-to-date antivirus
                protection, encryption and the use of privacy filters to secure
                all storage and transmission of personal data by us, and
